The mobile platform is Radar, a network of prevention and community action in which the co-design and participation of neighbours, shop-owners, students, volunteers and professionals from institutions are involved in problem-solving. During the workshop the attendees co-design solutions to facilitate and improve human life conditions in the public spaces of the seniors&rsquo; communities, using young people and their mobile skills as radars of digital culture. Students work together starting with an applied project based on methodology to build more human and supportive neighbourhoods with design-based thinking and an innovation-oriented process. The workshop consists of different phases (ideate, observe, test, prototype, iterate, learn) which result in new mobile services and products co-created based on seniors&rsquo; needs, especially the needs of women and migrants. &lsquo;Inclusion by mobile&rsquo; is a counterweight against loneliness, social isolation and exclusion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">The &lsquo;inclusion by mobile&rsquo; of girls and women, especially those living alone in the city, is the main objective of the workshop.

Some tips from the experts though: build a free and a paid version, build more than one so that you can cross-market your apps, and make sure that the content you provide is unique and engaging!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Freelance<\/strong><br \/>Everybody has a side gig these days. Your waitress is actually an actress and your dog walker is actually a writer. So, why aren&rsquo;t you getting a piece of the pie? Offering your coding skills as a freelancer means you get to set your own rates, select your projects, and create on your time table. Even if you need to dust off those coding skills or add a few new languages to your repertoire, according to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sanantoniocodingacademy.com\/\">San Antonio Coding Academy<\/a><\/strong>, you can do this in as little as two nights a week! With some fine-tuned, up-to-date coding skills, you can be bringing in extra cash in no time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Teach Others<\/strong><br \/>Let&rsquo;s say your skills are already off the charts. Share the wisdom! There is a huge demand for coding skills right now and people need proficient teachers to supply the demand! With so many people wanting to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sanantoniocodingacademy.com\/\">learn coding<\/a><\/strong>, turning teaching into an income stream is a no-brainer. You can teach at your local coding school or offer your services online. Many existing online services need mentors for students as well!<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Participate in Programming Contests<\/strong><br \/>Did you know you can even earn money competing as a coder? There are several online contests provided through websites like <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/topcoder.com\/\">Top Coder<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/\">Code Chef<\/a><\/strong>. that offer an easy way to earn some extra cash for the coder extraordinaire. They&rsquo;re easy to join and contestants have walked away with cash, prizes, and sometimes even job offers! What better way to spend your spare time than building bragging rights and making some moolah!<br \/><br \/>The bottom line is don&rsquo;t let those coding skills go to waste! It&rsquo;s like leaving money under your mattress. It&rsquo;s not earning interest, it&rsquo;s not building anything, and it&rsquo;s not maximizing it&rsquo;s potential. It&rsquo;s not doing anything for anybody! That same money could be invested and grow into so much more! Besides, if you don&rsquo;t use it, you lose it! So, drag out those coding skills, dust them off, and get to earning! Turn your skills into cold hard cash!<\/p>","social_impact":"","start_date":"2017-02-07","end_date":"2060-02-07","country":"United States","region":"Los Angeles","latitude":34.054935,"longitude":-118.2444759,"linked_organisation_ids":[],"who_we_help_tags":["software development","technology"],"support_tags":[{"id":"1","name":"Education and skills"}],"focus":[{"id":"9","name":"Open networks"}],"technology":[],"creation_date":"2017-02-07"},{"project_id":703,"project_name":"Coliving + Coworking for changemakers","website":"","short_description":"","long_description":"projects\r\r\n\r\r\nWe connect with various Creative Networked Communities to provide open access services to local community as well as reinforce global commons.

One of the most prominent examples of collaboration online is Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. It is a system where conflict is mediated by both policy and software, and where conflicts often reflect larger societal debates. <br \/><br \/>We are building a platform for the real-time analysis and visualization of such controversies in Wikipedia. Controversy metrics are extracted from the real time activity streams generated by edits to, and discussions about, individual articles and groups of related articles. An article&rsquo;s revision history and its corresponding discussion pages constitute two parallel streams of user interactions that, taken together, fully describe the process of the collaborative creation of an article. Our platform, Contropedia, builds on state of the art techniques and extends current metrics for the analysis of both edit and discussion activity. Furthermore, the combination of these two approaches allows for a deeper understanding of the substance, composition, actor alignment, trajectory and liveliness of controversies on Wikipedia.<br \/><br \/>The platform is designed with a special focus on the utility of the metrics and the public relevance of the visualizations: the metrics focus on the extraction of societal controversies while the visualizations aid in shaping new knowledge about the controversial topic.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>This research was made possible by EU FP7 EINS grant #288021 and in part by EU FP7 EMAPS grant #288964.<\/p>","social_impact":"<p>Our research aims to provide a better understanding of socio-technical phenomena that take place on the Internet and to equip citizens with tools to fully deploy the complexity of controversies.

With the facilitation service design can be carried out in an interactive and sustainable process. In this process data and input can be collected social interaction among the uses and the stakeholders and from the behavior of the users and the products, analyzed and quickly or directly fed back to the process. There is a need to investigate how to tightly combine and coordinate these computational, physical and social elements to facilitate the service and the design process of it.\r\r\n\r\r\nSocial computing is also seen as a computational platform for social innovation. The aim of the research in this respect is to develop methods, tools and techniques based on social computing to support design as social innovation and design for social innovation. In the case of design as social innovation, the research shall investigate how social computing can be used to support the collaborative design activities by the designers as well as other stakeholders including the end users and to enable collective creativity and intelligence in dealing with the complexity of the systems of today. In the case of design for social innovation, the research shall investigate how to use social computing for design to trigger and support social innovation that leads to societal transformations, by introducing design perspectives and design intervention in a social context.\r\r\n\r\r\nSocial computing could be used for validating design in earlier phases of the process. It is interesting to investigate how social computing could be utilized as a simulation platform for earlier concepts  in this case physical prototypes might be still be necessary but the situational context (people, other things and the environment) can be brought in or closer in order to quest the concept earlier.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe perspective and the competency of using social computing as an enabler in design should be implemented in the design education if the aim of the education is creating intelligent systems, products and related services in a social context. This research should investigate how this can be carried out in a competency-centered learning process, and how to utilize the social computing technologies to facilitate this process.","social_impact":"","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"country":"","region":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","linked_organisation_ids":["223"],"who_we_help_tags":[],"support_tags":[{"id":"3","name":"Culture and arts"},{"id":"1","name":"Education and skills"},{"id":"18","name":"Health and wellbeing"}],"focus":[{"id":"8","name":"Open data"},{"id":"4","name":"Open knowledge"}],"technology":[{"id":"939","name":"Artificial intelligence and machine learning"},{"id":"72","name":"big data"},{"id":"940","name":"Geotagging, GPS and GIS"},{"id":"929","name":"Mobile and web apps"},{"id":"8","name":"open data"},{"id":"935","name":"Open-source technologies"},{"id":"78","name":"sensors and internet of things"},{"id":"931","name":"Social networks and social media"}],"creation_date":"1970-01-01"},{"project_id":101,"project_name":"Design global, manufacture local","website":"","short_description":"","long_description":"The hypothetical productive model epitomized by the idea design globalmanufacture local can arguably be considered a working alternative which might perform better than the current unsustainable dominant value model while solving a number of systemic problems.

First life will be populated with entities\r\r\ndownloaded from open data (hospitals, shops, etc.) or added by users, which can create their own forms\r\r\ndescribing the fields of the entities and classifying them according to an ontology of social practices. For\r\r\nevery entity, users can add information, blogs, pictures, or organize online events, like chats to discuss\r\r\nrelated issues.\r\r\nThe goal of First Life is to make citizens more connected, more conscious of the place they live in and\r\r\nmore active. First Life harvests the knowledge and services which are now scattered around many\r\r\nwebsites often unknown to the wide public websites, focusing them on a local area. It reduces the\r\r\noverloading of information by filtering them on a locality principle. It can be the basis for co-production\r\r\n(in the sense of the Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom) and Do It Yourself activities, it can be used to advertise\r\r\nnew shops, services or events in the local area, it allows people to organize their own events, to start\r\r\ndiscussions on local issues.\r\r\nThe business model ensuring the sustainability of the project is to be financed by advertisements and by\r\r\ncontribution of citizens which want to become stakeholders of the local newspapers. Starting from a first\r\r\ntest neighbourhood, First Life will be extended to other ones and other cities using a franchising\r\r\nmechanism.\r\r\nFirst Life respond to the worries raised by existing social networks, such Google+ and Facebook. First,\r\r\nthe so called filter bubble noted by Eli Pariser: the personalization of information from social media\r\r\ncloses us in a private world reducing the opportunities for serendipity. Second, the reduction of social\r\r\nspace by social media, leading to an urban desert: as Evgeny Morozov says, public space is only what\r\r\nseparates our home from the restaurant with good online reviews our Google Car is driving us to.","social_impact":"","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"country":"","region":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","linked_organisation_ids":["72"],"who_we_help_tags":[],"support_tags":[{"id":"20","name":"Neighbourhood regeneration"},{"id":"2","name":"Participation and democracy"}],"focus":[{"id":"8","name":"Open data"},{"id":"4","name":"Open knowledge"},{"id":"9","name":"Open networks"}],"technology":[{"id":"933","name":"Crowdsourcing, crowdmapping and crowdfunding"},{"id":"940","name":"Geotagging, GPS and GIS"},{"id":"929","name":"Mobile and web apps"},{"id":"934","name":"Online marketplaces and noticeboards"},{"id":"938","name":"Peer-to-peer networks"},{"id":"931","name":"Social networks and social media"}],"creation_date":"1970-01-01"},{"project_id":689,"project_name":"Fix the web","website":"","short_description":"","long_description":"Change the culture around accessible technologies for disabled people","social_impact":"","start_date":null,"end_date":null,"country":"","region":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","linked_organisation_ids":["984"],"who_we_help_tags":[],"support_tags":[{"id":"18","name":"Health and wellbeing"}],"focus":[{"id":"4","name":"Open knowledge"}],"technology":[{"id":"933","name":"Crowdsourcing, crowdmapping and crowdfunding"},{"id":"931","name":"Social networks and social media"}],"creation_date":"1970-01-01"},{"project_id":140,"project_name":"Fixers","website":"","short_description":"","long_description":"Fixers started in 2008 as just an idea an idea given a voice by some 10,900 young people over the past five years.
