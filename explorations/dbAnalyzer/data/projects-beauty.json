    "long_description": "<p class=\"bodytext\">&nbsp;The project runs a mobile workshop using mobile phones as artefacts to create relationship between seniors, young people and the public space of the city. The mobile platform is Radar, a network of prevention and community action in which the co-design and participation of neighbours, shop-owners, students, volunteers and professionals from institutions are involved in problem-solving. During the workshop the attendees co-design solutions to facilitate and improve human life conditions in the public spaces of the seniors&rsquo; communities, using young people and their mobile skills as radars of digital culture. Students work together starting with an applied project based on methodology to build more human and supportive neighbourhoods with design-based thinking and an innovation-oriented process. The workshop consists of different phases (ideate, observe, test, prototype, iterate, learn) which result in new mobile services and products co-created based on seniors&rsquo; needs, especially the needs of women and migrants. &lsquo;Inclusion by mobile&rsquo; is a counterweight against loneliness, social isolation and exclusion.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">The &lsquo;inclusion by mobile&rsquo; of girls and women, especially those living alone in the city, is the main objective of the workshop. The project leaders consider public space and the design of public space as the first indicator of inclusion or exclusion and believe that mobile learning can foster open access and opportunities for all. The other aim of the project is to contribute to creating a digital and human narrative about the life conditions of people over 75 who live alone in the city, via young people and mobile learning &ndash; a kind of participatory m-storytelling.<\/p>",
    "social_impact": "<p class=\"bodytext\">The workshop is developed on the basis of design thinking and mobile learning methodology, in order to foster and acquire digital and human knowledge of the processes of human-centred design based on needs in context, within a mobile learning framework. &lsquo;Mobile inclusion&rsquo; includes psychological and sociocultural factors, cultural diversity, and intercultural, cross-cultural understanding, and responds to the needs identified by digital ethnography interviews and participatory analysis of the context &ndash; the public spaces shared by senior women and young girls. The project focuses on public space and &lsquo;inclusion by mobile&rsquo; in order to create an innovative approach, scalable in different realities and communities, to co-design our society starting from the squares, streets, shops and places we live day by day, and open this access to the world via mobile, giving opportunities for all.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

Apart from your standard 9-5 grind, there are many ways to make money while exercising your coding muscle!<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Build an App<\/strong><br \/>How many times have you thought,&rdquo;There should be an app for that?&rdquo; Well stop thinking and start building! Coding is a skill that allows you to realize visions and build something from nothing. If you might find that app useful or entertaining, there is a good chance others will too! Some tips from the experts though: build a free and a paid version, build more than one so that you can cross-market your apps, and make sure that the content you provide is unique and engaging!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Freelance<\/strong><br \/>Everybody has a side gig these days. Your waitress is actually an actress and your dog walker is actually a writer. So, why aren&rsquo;t you getting a piece of the pie? Offering your coding skills as a freelancer means you get to set your own rates, select your projects, and create on your time table. Even if you need to dust off those coding skills or add a few new languages to your repertoire, according to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sanantoniocodingacademy.com\/\">San Antonio Coding Academy<\/a><\/strong>, you can do this in as little as two nights a week! With some fine-tuned, up-to-date coding skills, you can be bringing in extra cash in no time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Teach Others<\/strong><br \/>Let&rsquo;s say your skills are already off the charts. Share the wisdom! There is a huge demand for coding skills right now and people need proficient teachers to supply the demand! With so many people wanting to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sanantoniocodingacademy.com\/\">learn coding<\/a><\/strong>, turning teaching into an income stream is a no-brainer. You can teach at your local coding school or offer your services online. Many existing online services need mentors for students as well!<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Participate in Programming Contests<\/strong><br \/>Did you know you can even earn money competing as a coder? There are several online contests provided through websites like <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/topcoder.com\/\">Top Coder<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.codechef.com\/\">Code Chef<\/a><\/strong>. that offer an easy way to earn some extra cash for the coder extraordinaire. They&rsquo;re easy to join and contestants have walked away with cash, prizes, and sometimes even job offers! What better way to spend your spare time than building bragging rights and making some moolah!<br \/><br \/>The bottom line is don&rsquo;t let those coding skills go to waste! It&rsquo;s like leaving money under your mattress. It&rsquo;s not earning interest, it&rsquo;s not building anything, and it&rsquo;s not maximizing it&rsquo;s potential. It&rsquo;s not doing anything for anybody! That same money could be invested and grow into so much more! Besides, if you don&rsquo;t use it, you lose it! So, drag out those coding skills, dust them off, and get to earning! Turn your skills into cold hard cash!<\/p>",

    "long_description": "<p>Collaborative content creation inevitably reaches situations where different points of view lead to conflict. One of the most prominent examples of collaboration online is Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. It is a system where conflict is mediated by both policy and software, and where conflicts often reflect larger societal debates. <br \/><br \/>We are building a platform for the real-time analysis and visualization of such controversies in Wikipedia. Controversy metrics are extracted from the real time activity streams generated by edits to, and discussions about, individual articles and groups of related articles. An article&rsquo;s revision history and its corresponding discussion pages constitute two parallel streams of user interactions that, taken together, fully describe the process of the collaborative creation of an article. Our platform, Contropedia, builds on state of the art techniques and extends current metrics for the analysis of both edit and discussion activity. Furthermore, the combination of these two approaches allows for a deeper understanding of the substance, composition, actor alignment, trajectory and liveliness of controversies on Wikipedia.<br \/><br \/>The platform is designed with a special focus on the utility of the metrics and the public relevance of the visualizations: the metrics focus on the extraction of societal controversies while the visualizations aid in shaping new knowledge about the controversial topic.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>This research was made possible by EU FP7 EINS grant #288021 and in part by EU FP7 EMAPS grant #288964.<\/p>",

Contropedia will be useful for the general public as well as user groups with specific interests such as Wikipedians, scientists, decision makers and media communicators.<\/p>",

While some European countries and regions are world-leaders in this field, others are just beginning to embrace design as an economic driver.

    "long_description": "The research of this DESIS Lab shall confront aforementioned three challenges, focusing in social computing not just as a technology, but more importantly as an enabler (a platform or a tool) in a design context.\r\r\n\r\r\nSocial computing is firstly seen as the computational facilitation of service centric design that integrates the Web of People with the Internet of things, that shortens the feedback loop in adaptive systems and services, and that enables the service to be carried out in in a more flattened and bottom up social structure. With the facilitation service design can be carried out in an interactive and sustainable process. In this process data and input can be collected social interaction among the uses and the stakeholders and from the behavior of the users and the products, analyzed and quickly or directly fed back to the process. There is a need to investigate how to tightly combine and coordinate these computational, physical and social elements to facilitate the service and the design process of it.\r\r\n\r\r\nSocial computing is also seen as a computational platform for social innovation. The aim of the research in this respect is to develop methods, tools and techniques based on social computing to support design as social innovation and design for social innovation. In the case of design as social innovation, the research shall investigate how social computing can be used to support the collaborative design activities by the designers as well as other stakeholders including the end users and to enable collective creativity and intelligence in dealing with the complexity of the systems of today. In the case of design for social innovation, the research shall investigate how to use social computing for design to trigger and support social innovation that leads to societal transformations, by introducing design perspectives and design intervention in a social context.\r\r\n\r\r\nSocial computing could be used for validating design in earlier phases of the process. It is interesting to investigate how social computing could be utilized as a simulation platform for earlier concepts  in this case physical prototypes might be still be necessary but the situational context (people, other things and the environment) can be brought in or closer in order to quest the concept earlier.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe perspective and the competency of using social computing as an enabler in design should be implemented in the design education if the aim of the education is creating intelligent systems, products and related services in a social context. This research should investigate how this can be carried out in a competency-centered learning process, and how to utilize the social computing technologies to facilitate this process.",

Older people in sheltered housing schemes have improved quality of life including being less isolated, more mentally active, better informed and better off financially because they are more digitally included.\r\r\n2. Older people involved in the intergenerational theme of the project have increased contact across the generations leading to more developed online skills for older people and better communication skills for young people leading to a better understanding of each other for both groups.\r\r\n3. Organisations caring for older people are more likely to promote digital inclusion because they have access to research and practical toolkits.",

More often than not, one must answer for all reckless consumption and merriment; yet most of us continue to make choices which are detrimental to our futures.\r\r\n \r\r\nOur Solution:\r\r\nWe believe that a behavioural change intervention, at a social-network level, is required if we are to calm our rate of consumption to manageable levels.\r\r\n \r\r\nWe have leveraged behavioural economics techniques from the evidence based, Road Safety  Average Speed Camera Intervention to allow people to self-select themselves to a programme of social surveillance, using wearable devices to remotely compete in games of discipline against friends and family, and by so doing maintain target behaviours that reduce consumption rates or increase activity levels to compensate for consumption rates.\r\r\n \r\r\nWhy Now:\r\r\nThe explosion of sensors we are witnessing today is spurring innovation across industry due to their effectiveness of price point, innovation in what can be measured, and the existence of ubiquitous networks to allow the aggregation of that data. \r\r\n\r\r\nFor the first time we have the technology to monitor and validate adherence to target behaviour remotely. Nowhere is that more important than in the health and wellbeing space, where the world faces epic challenges coming from an aging population, a centralised health system that is straining to scale to current demands, and growing health concerns due to obesity and diabetes. \r\r\n",

Huge sums of public money have supported digital innovation in business, as well as in fields ranging from the military to espionage.

These range from social networks for those living with chronic health conditions, to online platforms for citizen participation in policymaking, to using open data to create more transparency about public spending. We call this digital social innovation (DSI). We have set up digitalsocial.eu to build a network of digital social innovation in Europe.

    "long_description": "<p>So where do students go when they don&rsquo;t receive the grades they had to wish for? It used to be the newspaper, then it was UCAS Online, now it seems that every student reaches into their pocket and grabs their smartphone, not to call their family members, but to search for their university course. That&rsquo;s the reason that ed-tech company, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/universitycompare.com\/\">University Compare<\/a><\/strong> is slowly becoming a household name.<\/p>\n<p>University Compare raised $262,575 in their latest funding round to help demystify the university application process and to provide guidance to those <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/universitycompare.com\/university-advice\/\">applying to university<\/a><\/strong>. University Compare&rsquo;s App &lsquo;Clearing&rsquo; was a major milestone this year thanks to it sitting still of the UK App store for more than one week and generating more than 28 million app store views.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine that you&rsquo;re an 18-year-old college student and your results were not exactly what you had hoped for, or better than expected - the odds are you are likely to change your university. You now have to search through tens of thousands of courses and fast. It needs something innovative and Owen O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s mobile venture did exactly that, it&rsquo;s also probably why the search term &lsquo;Clearing&rsquo; was seen all August.<\/p>\n<p>University Compare&rsquo;s app &lsquo;Clearing&rsquo; featured helped fund more than &pound;60m worth of university tuition, a major dent in the higher education section thanks to over 46,000 user logins on A Level Results Day. Owen O&rsquo;Neill went on to say:<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;A student logged into use our service every 1.8s, which, as we watched in real-time on the day was phenomenal. It&rsquo;s clear that there is a shift in the way students research their university choices and luckily we&rsquo;re at the forefront of this movement.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know entering into Clearing can be an emotional experience for school leavers, so we put a lot of time and effort into developing an app that serves as a useful and easy-to-use resource with the kind of info we know students want to know.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>University Compare has gone from strength-to-strength and boasts some impressive stats, they are set to hit a 1000% increase in their student registrations along with a 300% increase in site traffic, all in 9 short months - it seems this edtech company is making clear and yet very smart moves.<\/p>\n<p>The site uses reviews from former students with a social-led rating system, users can compare average graduate salaries, employment rates, student satisfaction and even the cost of a local pint at the university they&rsquo;re interested in.<\/p>\n<p>Their latest funding round was secured via Seedrs.com and scooped &pound;75,000 from previous Sportingbet founder, Mark Blandford. Sportingbet was sold to William Hill in 2013 for an est. $650 million. Mark Blandford when on to say:<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;University Compare has a clear value proposition in a growing marketing, in my opinion, O&rsquo;Neill understands the opportunity and how to execute on it. I look forward to working with him.&rdquo;<\/p>",

    "long_description": "First Life is a project funded by the call Smart Cities and Communities and Social innovation of Ministry\r\r\nof University and Research of Italy for young reseachers under 30 years.\r\r\nFirst Life proposes a new social network which revises the basis of existing ones and has the following\r\r\ncharacteristics:\r\r\n1) It offers a geo-referenced representation like Google Maps does, but it is more dense and interactive.\r\r\n2) It does not have a global scope, but it is focused on neighours, the dimension where we live our\r\r\neveryday life.\r\r\n3) It is mediated in that every neighbourhood is associated with a journalist which re-elaborates the\r\r\ninformation put by citizens on the social network and manages a local newspaper proposing topics of\r\r\ninterests for the citizens.\r\r\nBy more dense and interactive we mean that the citizens can not only put opinions on restaurants like it\r\r\nhappens now, but they can put information about every aspect of the local reality they live in, from\r\r\nschools to playgrounds, from entertainment events to local news. First life will be populated with entities\r\r\ndownloaded from open data (hospitals, shops, etc.) or added by users, which can create their own forms\r\r\ndescribing the fields of the entities and classifying them according to an ontology of social practices. For\r\r\nevery entity, users can add information, blogs, pictures, or organize online events, like chats to discuss\r\r\nrelated issues.\r\r\nThe goal of First Life is to make citizens more connected, more conscious of the place they live in and\r\r\nmore active. First Life harvests the knowledge and services which are now scattered around many\r\r\nwebsites often unknown to the wide public websites, focusing them on a local area. It reduces the\r\r\noverloading of information by filtering them on a locality principle. It can be the basis for co-production\r\r\n(in the sense of the Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom) and Do It Yourself activities, it can be used to advertise\r\r\nnew shops, services or events in the local area, it allows people to organize their own events, to start\r\r\ndiscussions on local issues.\r\r\nThe business model ensuring the sustainability of the project is to be financed by advertisements and by\r\r\ncontribution of citizens which want to become stakeholders of the local newspapers. Starting from a first\r\r\ntest neighbourhood, First Life will be extended to other ones and other cities using a franchising\r\r\nmechanism.\r\r\nFirst Life respond to the worries raised by existing social networks, such Google+ and Facebook. First,\r\r\nthe so called filter bubble noted by Eli Pariser: the personalization of information from social media\r\r\ncloses us in a private world reducing the opportunities for serendipity. Second, the reduction of social\r\r\nspace by social media, leading to an urban desert: as Evgeny Morozov says, public space is only what\r\r\nseparates our home from the restaurant with good online reviews our Google Car is driving us to.",

This demonstrates the diligence shown by the regional coordinators in matching the skill set of the Pioneer to the hosts needs, enabling a cross polination of ideas to flourish. The guiding philosophy of the programme is to position pionners outside of their usual structure of operation so that they can learn and adapt, developing unique approaches and bringing new impetus to the challenges faced by the hosts. PiP aims to create a community which combines interdisciplinary and technical knowledge with management ability, through experiential work based learning, promoting the mobility of professionals between research and education, trade and the public sector.

The project aims to increase the level of citizen&rsquo;s satisfaction with public services, to increase citizens and NGOs participation in local public discussions and to increase their influence in policymaking. It targets cultural and socio-economical marginalized groups, local decision makers, and the general public in municipalities of Prishtina, Gjakova, Gjilan, Ferizaj and Fushe Kosova. Implementation of the project started on 1st&nbsp;of September 2015 and is expected to end on 28th&nbsp;of February 2017.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The main aims of the project are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>The training of interest groups in using contemporary tools and methodologies for activism and influencing decision-making processes.

Through these manuals it is aimed to create strategies and proper living conditions for the citizens.<\/div>\n<div>Founding inclusive advisory groups for decision-making in social housing.The aim of these groups, which will also include women, disabled people and marginalized groups, is to provide equal dissemination of social housing units within municipalities in the best possible way, by prioritizing the most needed beneficiaries.<\/div>\n<div>Building mechanisms for accountability to the citizens.It includes building a communication\/reporting platform for smart phones for reporting the damages or misuse of public space and social housing. Reporting will be done by sending photographs and describing the damage\/misuse and its location in the application. These complaints will be sent to the municipality&rsquo;s inspectorate, which is expected to intervene with the needed measures. Thus the communication and transparency between the municipality and citizens will increase.<\/div>\n<div>Raising public awareness for the universal right to public space, social and affordable housing.Within the project will be organized public debates and discussions among local decision makers, NGO-s and the general public, presentations for high school students and workshops for local students and groups of interest, and will be published informing brochures for the citizens&rsquo; rights and responsibilities in public space and for application methods and conditions for social and affordable housing.<\/div>",

This direct communication is expected to make citizens more co-operative with their government and their fellow-citizens and contribute to their sense of purpose and meaning towards the empowerment of the citys collective awareness.

    "long_description": "The Lokalizo project is now in the sixth month of implementation and over this time young people who have joined Lokalizo were introduced to the concept of digital mapping through a set of workshops and activities focusing on digital engagement, youth empowerment and community advocacy. Lokalizo through its partnership with Voices of Youth Maps offers a youth friendly technology that can be used by trained young people to securely collect stories and reports regarding their neighborhood.\r\r\n\r\r\nAggregated reports serve as a powerful tool to promote interventions by the community and its leaders to achieve the desired changes. The Lokalizo project addresses 9 thematic categories: walking hazards, accumulation of garbage, collapse risks, water management, recreational parks, urban traffic, sanitation problems, urban green spaces and forests, response to humanitarian disasters. \r\r\n\r\r\n(In respect to the latter category and in light of the recent floods in the Balkans, our team has been invited at the Mikser Festival 2014 in Belgrade to present how youth-led initiatives similar to Lokalizo can respond to such crisis in the future.)\r\r\n\r\r\nOur team has been able to create a solid circle of stakeholders in the city of Prishtina, while we are working everyday to expand this circle. Simultaneously, we are looking at opportunities to expand the service offered through Lokalizo to other cities, with the goal to stretch on national level. \r\r\n\r\r\nThe social enterprise contributes positively to social change by empowering a number of people who join us as youth mappers. While the activism of young people pushes governmental institutions to join us as stakeholders and collaborate to jointly improve the quality of life in our communities.  Lokalizo successfully creates feedback loops where direct communication between agents of positive change, elected representatives, and those responsible to provide remedies can easily collaborate to establish the needed results. \r\r\n",

    "long_description": "<p>The raise of Fablabs and other maker spaces is creating new opportunities for citizen-driven innovation in domains ranging from open hardware to digital fabrication, community informatics, and participatory sensing. In the past five years, the broad availability of open hardware tools, the creation of online data sharing platforms, and access to maker spaces have fostered the design of low cost and open source sensors that citizens can appropriate to engage in environmental action. By collectively measuring and making sense of their environment, citizens can become aware of how their lifestyle affects the ecosystem and be inspired to adopt more sustainable behaviours.<\/p>\n<p>Official bodies typically measure environmental qualities with sparse networks of high quality sensors, and the resulting data are analysed to inform policy and regulations. At the same time, with the exception of extreme cases like smog pollution, citizens tend to be unaware of the health threats that they are subjected to on a daily basis. Moreover, they lack the means to act on their own behalf. By encouraging and enabling the creation of bottom-up sensor networks, and sharing the resulting data and knowledge, the EU-funded project Making Sense aims to add to the available data and understanding, and contribute to a healthier and cleaner environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Toolkit<\/strong><br \/>Making Sense will show how open source software, open source hardware, digital maker practices and open design can be used by local communities to make sense of their environments. It will develop a <strong>Making Sense Toolkit<\/strong> based on the <a class=\"ext\" href=\"https:\/\/smartcitizen.me\/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Citizen<\/a> platform for bottom up citizen science, developed at Fablab Barcelona. The toolkit will be developed and tested in nine pilots in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Pristina.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Based on these pilots, we will develop framework for participatory environmental maker practices. It will show how to provide citizens and communities with tools to enhance their everyday environmental awareness, to enable active intervention in their surroundings, and to change their individual and collective practices. And finally we will develop will develop a framework for citizen co-inquiry and action towards transformation of their surroundings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stakeholders and funding<\/strong><br \/>Making Sense will run from November 2015 to the end of 2017.

    "long_description": "The beneficiaries of the project will be patients that require the use of clinical skills for a given medical condition. Medhance has benefits for each, which the current methods do not provide. There are a vast number and a range of patient requiring different clinical skills thus it cannot be quantified into a single figure but this is a huge potential audience.\r\r\n\r\r\nMedhance will also benefit patients who are poorly educated, in a low socio-economic class, in an ethnic minority speaking little English or require a carer. Even though it takes these patients into account, it is aimed at all patients requiring the use of a clinical skill no matter what their background is. Thus could potentially have a dangerous result of not knowing how to perform their clinical skill correctly, due to not having suitable and validated resources targetted to them. While patients who are well educated or in a high socioeconomic class have access to a wider range of facilities along with better understanding. This is reflected, not just across the UK but throughout Europe. \r\r\n\r\r\nFor patients who are poorly educated, the features in Medhance are perfectly suited to them. So if they are not able to read or have poor literacy skills along with poor understanding of complex medical terminology, then the patient can be shown how to perform the clinical skill via a video, which they can watch at their own pace or repeatedly if they wanted to. \r\r\n\r\r\nFor patients who are in a lower socio-economic class and cannot afford the access to advanced resources, Medhance does not charge them. This is because the content is free as the healthcare provider covers the cost for a small fee. This allows them to have the same benefits as higher socio-economic classes. \r\r\n\r\r\nFor patients who are from ethic minorities and do not speak much English, Medhance overcomes this barrier by making the information available in several languages. Thus having the information already translated does not make them rely on translators or using relatives as translators, which can be life-threatening when used for medical information. \r\r\n\r\r\nFor patients who require a carer such a specific elderly patients, Medhance allows there carers to use this if they were not present when showed the skill. It also has advantages for patients who are affected by more than one medical condition and require the use of several clinical skills. This allows the easy access for them, as the information is in one place. Thus Medhance will be a useful resource for these patients. \r\r\n\r\r\nThere are several recipients of Medhance who will take advantage of its features and will have a social impact on them as medical education tool. This impact will empower patients by enhancing their knowledge, quality of care and overall health outcomes. Therefore, also preventing hospital admissions and reducing the number of emergency department attendees. Most importantly it will improve their quality of lives.\r\r\n",

    "long_description": "Museomix is inspired by the open, participative and networked practices that have emerged from the web. It?s an event-driven community of museum innovators that harnesses their collective energies over three days, and enables them to change the museum from within.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Museomix project was founded in 2011 by five very different persons and entities working in the culture and innovation sectors: the agencies Nod-a and Buzzeum, the research laboratory Erasme, Samuel Bausson and Julien Dorra. It is now driven by an  active community of art and history enthusiasts, museum staff, innovators, designers, coders, community organizers, makers and tinkerers that grows each year, including The French Ministry of Cultural Affairs.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhy is Museomix here?\r\r\nIf we are not satisfied with the way museums work, why not make the museum we would love to visit and work for? Why not make it a creative platform? This is the question we asked when setting up Museomix.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe love museums, but sometimes it feels like museums don?t really love us back. They are filled with rules, shushing guards, admonitions against photography. They can give us a sense that we?re somewhere we don?t belong, where our rights and agency are diminished, where we are more limited than usual to do, or play, as we please.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuseum professionals ? especially those working in digital and the web ? are frequently frustrated: there are many new possibilities for mediation and the museum experience. They are discussed in conferences and prototyped in workshops. But when museum professionals try to bring these ideas back to their own museums, innovation can seem out of reach.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuseomix was born out of this frustration. It?s a way to bridge the gap between participatory web culture and institutional museum culture, between peer-to-peer logic and pyramidal organisation.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuseomix wants to demonstrate that museums can work differently, and that a disruptive experience can initiate change throughout an organisation.\r\r\n\r\r\nOver three days Museomix make it happen for real in museums where people can be creative and have an immediate impact.\r\r\n\r\r\nBeyond visitors: reaching out to museum user communities\r\r\nVisitors want many things out of their museum visit: students, teachers, parents and children; designers, artists and photographers; tourists and researchers; amateurs and bloggers ? all have different motivations to visit.\r\r\n\r\r\nIf you look closely at their habits and practices, you?ll find that they are much more than visitors: they are really museum users.\r\r\n\r\r\nBeyond simply watching, they seek diverse experiences: photographing, drawing, posing, dancing, learning, loitering, meeting, eating ? experiences that they like to share with friends, and that they can?t always have in museums.\r\r\n\r\r\nMuseomix opens the door to people who want to make a place for themselves. Museomix lets visitors imagine a cultural space that let them become engaged users and evolves with them.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Museomix community shares a vision of today?s museum, co-edited in 2012:\r\r\n\r\r\na museum that is open and inclusive to people, their uses, and the use of their content;\r\r\na museum that is connected, and works outside-in with its user communities;\r\r\na participatory museum, where contemplating is one of many ways to relate artworks, where people can share and create ? a read-write museum.\r\r\nMuseomix allows users to own their experiences. Users help museums to change.",

    "long_description": "<p>nformation and communication technologies are key components of a modern society, and their control is the key to societal development. The advent of the Internet has been often invoked as a remedy for their democratization and the diffusion of fundamental human rights. The light of truth shows today a different picture: the digital divide is widening the gap between those who can access and take advantage of the new systems, and those who remain &ldquo;disconnected&rdquo; (with respect to physical access to technology, economic advantages, cultural uses and skills, and democratic impacts). A problem is emerging about the Internet&rsquo;s sustainability, both socio-economic (large Internet corporations eluding taxes and aggressively commercializing most services) and political-democratic (the global Internet surveillance and the lack of transparency). This, coupled with the complexity of the Internet&rsquo;s organisation and the diffused lack of awareness about its actual implementation makes the users easy targets of manipulation, and unaware of the possibility to have a bottom-up, democratic, communal organisation of &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;.<br \/><br \/>netCommons aspires to study, support and further promote an emerging trend, community-based networking and communication services that can offer a complement, or even a sustainable alternative, to the global Internet&rsquo;s current dominant model. Community networks not only provide citizens with access to a neutral, bottom-up network infrastructure, which naturally increases the transparency of data flow, but they also represent an archetype of networked collective cooperation and action, mixing common or communal ownership and management of an infrastructure with a balanced set of services supported by the local stakeholders. Community networks, however, are complex systems that require multiple skills to thrive: technical, legal, socio-economic, and political. They face many challenges and they also need abstractions, models and practical tools to grow and produce a higher beneficial impact on our society.<br \/><br \/>netCommons follows a dual approach to achieve the maximum possible impact. On the one hand, the project works at the local level, mingling with the communities that implement and manage community networks to gather relevant information, elaborate it, and then return to communities advanced conceptual and technical tools helping them to grow and thrive. On the other hand, starting from such hands-on experience and work, netCommons contributes to Internet Science by abstracting concepts and opening the perspective to the world of global communications. It studies solutions and interpretations of how to build global awareness about the importance of sustainability, participation, co-operation, freedom, democracy, peer production, the public and common good, and the role of community networks to help this process. Consequently, netCommons will foster the implementation of the proper actions (local to communities and global to the regulatory level) that can guarantee that information creation and diffusion remains free, neutral, fair, and respectful of individual rights.<\/p>",

In a couple of months, over 10,000 anonymous players from over 100 countries played over 12,000 games and generated a database of over 300,000 clicks. It was shown that an algorithm that combines 13 games from non-experts playing on the same image translates into a perfect parasite counting- as good as an expert microscopist.\r\r\n\r\r\nMalariaspot is currently working with the Barcelona Centre for International Health to roll out a real-time system prototype in health clinics across sub-Saharan Africa.

And change is accelerating. While we do not know what tomorrow&rsquo;s problems are going to be, we know there will be many, and we know we will need everyone equipped to deal with them. We all must be emphatic innovators, able to collaborate, create, and act in changing environments.<\/p>\n<p>Opencare brings people together, in the virtual and physical world, to share stories and create new solutions rooted in people's everyday realities, needs, and lifestyles.<\/p>",
    "social_impact": "<p>For most of humanity's history, care services &ndash; which today we call health and social care &ndash; were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other's children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.<\/p>\n<p>This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people&hellip;) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are going to attempt to do just that. We are launching OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. We will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>collect experiences of community-driven care services<\/li>\n<li>validate them through open discussion, both online and offline.<\/li>\n<li>augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking&hellip;)<\/li>\n<li>combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we'll do it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process will be &ndash; and stay &ndash; open to anyone who wants to participate. We are working on a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution, and will not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Care is deeply human<\/strong>. Everyone has first-hand experience of it. Even those if us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receving care. So, everyone is welcome to join the conversation and the subsequent prototypes. If you want to be involved you can stay up to date through the <a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bNlau5\">newsletter<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/edgeryders.eu\/user\/register\">sign up<\/a> to Edgeryders and come talk to us on our <a href=\"https:\/\/edgeryders.eu\/en\/opencare-research\">workspace<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>OpenCare is led by YOU, and assisted by a world-class partnership: Edgeryders, the University of Bordeaux, the City of Milan, WeMake, ScImpulse Foundation and the Stockholm School of Economics. &nbsp;We will find a way to move forward together. We are grateful for the support of the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme.&nbsp;<\/p>",

    "long_description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the MK:Smart project the Open University and Community Action: MK have been working closely to establish a model which provides opportunities for citizens to be involved in designing their own smarter city. We have achieved this through a process we branded as Our MK, taking people&rsquo;s initial ideas and supporting them to become a reality. The 4 key elements involved have been:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community Engagement<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Development of Ideas<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competition for Funding &amp; Support<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support &amp; Guidance<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MK:Smart has been a useful way of trying and testing an effective process for supporting citizen innovation and we are now looking to extend this beyond the end of the MK:Smart project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Community Engagement<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community engagement is a fundamental baseline to all successful projects. We engaged people using Community Action: MK&rsquo;s Community Mobilisers. They went out into communities to initiate conversations face to face about smart city topics, which were all recorded on our <\/span><strong>QuickChat Dialogue App<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We collected over 900 pieces of conversation in the initial stages of the project, which gave an insight to people&rsquo;s priorities. We are also able to target hard to reach groups, such as in more deprived areas, ethnic minorities and young people, that are least likely to bring themselves into such conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find out more about our QuickChat Dialogue App visit<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.communityactionk.org\/communities\/quickchatdialogueapp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.communityactionk.org\/communities\/quickchatdialogueapp<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Development of Ideas<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bringing like minded people together, is also a useful way to spark further discussion and initiate new ideas. We provided people with the opportunity to collaborate in two ways; at <\/span><strong>workshops, focus groups and networking events<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; and online via the <\/span><strong>Our MK Collaboration Platform<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a website where people could post ideas and collaborate on others ideas. This has formed the start of our<\/span><strong> Innovation Network <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a space where people can develop ideas and share and support each other. We already have over 280 people signed up to our regular newsletters, and even more have attended events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can visit the Our MK website at <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ourmk.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.ourmk.org<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Competition for Funding &amp; Support<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Our MK Competition provided a target for people with ideas to work towards and encouraged citizens to consolidate their ideas into something achievable and within their reach. We promoted the opportunity widely using social media, newsletters, press releases, posters, newspaper adverts and shared information at our networking events. The <\/span><strong>application process<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was fine tuned and the type of support was adapted based on what worked through this project. We held drop in style sessions where people could come for advice, workshops to discuss ideas and in the end had 18 applications for funding. A <\/span><strong>Funding Panel <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made up of senior partners used an assessment criteria to decide on those to fund and the 18 were whittled down to 11 that fit within the MK:Smart criteria.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Support &amp; Guidance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New ideas need to be nurtured and this is happening through providing the awarded project owners with <\/span><strong>one to one support<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through an assigned member of the Community Action: MK team. That team member was able to meet them on a regular basis and offer assistance for various elements of their project dependant on their needs. We could provide useful links to MK:Smart project partners for <\/span><strong>specialist expertise and knowledge<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as key figures in the council, or within businesses or academia. Our ongoing support has also included sharing opportunities to be more involved in local decisions such as attending workshops and accessing further funding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For general information about MK:Smart visit <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mksmart.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.mksmart.org<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or the Citizen Innovation workpackage visit <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mksmart.org\/citizens\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.mksmart.org\/citizens<\/span><\/a><\/p>",

Genera nuevas expectativas laborales entre la poblacion joven del barrio que siente que puede tener alguna opcion laboral a corto- medio plazo en un sector de futuro. En el caso de Saregune ha significado que, a partir del primer ano de funcionamiento, hemos contado con una media de 60 candidaturas para cada Plan \r\r\nde empleo con cabida para 10 personas. \r\r\n3. En bastantes casos ha supuesto un retorno al aprendizaje normalizado por parte de personas que, procedentes del fracaso escolar, habian perdido toda esperanza y confianza en el sistema educativo, generando nuevas posibilidades formativas a traves del autoaprendizaje apoyado, la formacion continua y el aprendizaje permanente vinculado a las tecnologias. \r\r\n4. Contribuye a ofrecer alternativas de insercion como recurso para los Servicios Sociales de Base de zona en su trabajo social y comunitario, aportando alternativas viables para avanzar y mejorar las condiciones de algunas de las personas a las que atienden, a quienes pueden proponer como candidatas a participar en alguno de los procesos. \r\r\n5. Fomenta la creacion y consolidacion de un capital social rico e interconectado. En base a las necesidades tecnologicas se generan sinergias y grupos de interes comun que facilitan el acercamiento y el trabajo compartido entre la iniciativa social. \r\r\n6. Ayuda a modificar estereotipos negativos del vecindario tanto hacia las personas del barrio contratadas, cuyo rol pasa a ser de servicio a la comunidad, como entre las personas usuarias que en este entorno pueden sacar a la luz sus conocimientos (de otros idiomas, de manejo de las tecnologias, ..) y romper con muchos prejuicios respecto a las personas extranjeras y otras etnias y sus respectivos usos culturales. \r\r\n7. Socializa, desmitifica y horizontaliza el papel de la tecnologia ayudando a ver su papel y uso social, no exclusivamente mercantil. El uso del software libre en el proceso ayuda a profundizar en los valores de la colaboracion, de la creacion compartida del conocimiento y su contribucion a la creacion cultural libre. \r\r\n",

The project promotes literacy in the fields of design, electronics and programming, by implementing a series of workshops for teen and preteen (ages 11-&shy;18) patients of the Pediatric Onco-hematology department and Transplant Center of Regina Margherita Hospital, in Turin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robo&amp;Bobo is one of 19 projects awarded by the Digital for Social program, which were selected for the potential social or organizational impact of the promoting association, evaluated according to the level of technological innovation, feasibility, and financial sustainability of the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, the workshops will focus on:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the creation of simplified interactive artifacts, customizable through a combination of common materials and recycled electronic components and sensors (electronic boards like Arduino for example);<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the definition of a learning path for digital literacy, simplified 3D modeling, introduction to digital fabrication technology and 3D printing, plug&amp;play e-kits with sensors, actuators and conductive paint.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the activities aim to make IT skills stand out not only as learning goals, but as means to introduce new and interesting activities that make technology, science and design accessible, revealing their potential for play and creativity. The young adults involved in the workshops become active builders of their own knowledge path, leading to the pursuit of a growing reflection, awareness and self-assessment of their own cognitive processes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project&rsquo;s main goals are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to enhance the educational \/ occupational offer available within the hospital;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to offer tools that foster personal expression and cognitive empowerment;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to offer participants the chance to come into direct contact with stimulating activities, completing an important, specific experience and learning also through hands-on practice;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to offer useful tools to face periods of hospitalization, extending beyond workshop activities, with patients using what they have learned for their personal interest;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to propose a model that is open to collaboration with similar local, national and international projects, building bridges and creating exchanges that can guarantee the growth and the replication of the project.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project&rsquo;s <\/span><strong>learning-by-doing<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> approach merges innovation, education and inclusion.

    "long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inspired by close-knit communities, the proposal is to promote the free association of people for common purposes by adding a layer of social trust on the Web with no central control and with simple rules of operation. First, by interconnecting a multitude of human-sized communities, social trust stays strong&nbsp;and engagement is more likely to&nbsp;occur. Second, assuming that bad reputation repels and good reputation attracts, the IoC aims to explore how collective reputation can be used as a catalyst to regulate social interactions within these small social clusters. If individuals&rsquo; reputation affect each other, a collective reputation mechanism could act as a systematic incentive to inhibit behaviors that are detrimental to the collective reputational asset, and to foster those that are beneficial to the group. Third, unable to increase the size of their network beyond a certain limit, and tied by a collective reputation, users need&nbsp;to remain attractive to the rest of their community if they do not want to be replaced by more outstanding peers.&nbsp;As a result, there is a strong incentive to anchor relationships in reciprocity, fairness and excellence. Influence and leadership are&nbsp;more likely to shift to those who positively impact their communities, to those who lead by example, and to those who reciprocate with fairness.<\/p>",
    "social_impact": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Designed from first principles, this proposal for a distributed social environment introduces both a collective intelligence mechanism and a resource allocation system to actualize greater human, social and economic value from online communities.

In such work, we need contact with environments that are good on provident planning, future-oriented technology development, climate change, transport development, geopolitics, etc.\r\r\nThe four major transport modalities in Norway (aviation, road, rail and sea transport) meet in Bod. Bod Airport is one of six national airports and Bodo harbor is one of seven designated national ports. Bodo is only place in Norway where national port national airport, railway and road meet within walking distance. When developing new district and a new airport will these four transport carriers could be integrated within the same industry area. This opens unique opportunities for both freight and passenger transport, both in a national perspective but also in the arctic and global perspective.\r\r\nA development of Bodo intermodal hub will also in a long term be associated with uncertainty in relation to developments in Northern Norway and the Arctic.

As such VOICE bridges the gap between entrepreneurial need and action, reducing barriers to entry for both individuals and embryonic start-ups. VOICE  ecosystem provides business, technical and community services so as to enhance start-up growth and maximize their chances of survival. At the same time VOICE will act as an innovation marketplace and a global investment opportunity ecosystem for the B2B community (i.e., investment community, companies); as well as a medium for universities consulting companies and individuals to offer their services. By fulfilling these goals and supporting individuals and companies, across all stages from the need, to intellectual property ownership and control, to start-up creation, this virtual incubation ecosystem will thus contribute to the creation of jobs and wealth across the broader community. \r\r\n\r\r\nVOICE serves as inclusive, social entrepreneurship ecosystem that will offer an easily accessible online environment to support collaborative business creation. The online character of the VOICE will stimulate further the entrepreneurial and innovation activity by weakening existing imbalances for entrepreneurs between urban and rural areas by offering equal opportunities to individuals that do not live in major cities, to women and community groups with disabilities.\r\r\n\r\r\n",
