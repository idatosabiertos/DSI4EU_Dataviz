	The percentage of ideas in the platform that become self-sustained projects after one year. We will compare this success rate with the average success rate of entrepreneurs in order to measure our own impact;
	The evolution of indicators measuring the intensity of cooperation on the platform:
	percentage of projects addressing requests to the community;

The mobile platform is Radar, a network of prevention and community action in which the co-design and participation of neighbours, shop-owners, students, volunteers and professionals from institutions are involved in problem-solving. During the workshop the attendees co-design solutions to facilitate and improve human life conditions in the public spaces of the seniors&rsquo; communities, using young people and their mobile skills as radars of digital culture. Students work together starting with an applied project based on methodology to build more human and supportive neighbourhoods with design-based thinking and an innovation-oriented process. The workshop consists of different phases (ideate, observe, test, prototype, iterate, learn) which result in new mobile services and products co-created based on seniors&rsquo; needs, especially the needs of women and migrants. &lsquo;Inclusion by mobile&rsquo; is a counterweight against loneliness, social isolation and exclusion.</p>
<p class=""bodytext"">The &lsquo;inclusion by mobile&rsquo; of girls and women, especially those living alone in the city, is the main objective of the workshop. The project leaders consider public space and the design of public space as the first indicator of inclusion or exclusion and believe that mobile learning can foster open access and opportunities for all. The other aim of the project is to contribute to creating a digital and human narrative about the life conditions of people over 75 who live alone in the city, via young people and mobile learning &ndash; a kind of participatory m-storytelling.</p>","<p class=""bodytext"">The workshop is developed on the basis of design thinking and mobile learning methodology, in order to foster and acquire digital and human knowledge of the processes of human-centred design based on needs in context, within a mobile learning framework. &lsquo;Mobile inclusion&rsquo; includes psychological and sociocultural factors, cultural diversity, and intercultural, cross-cultural understanding, and responds to the needs identified by digital ethnography interviews and participatory analysis of the context &ndash; the public spaces shared by senior women and young girls. The project focuses on public space and &lsquo;inclusion by mobile&rsquo; in order to create an innovative approach, scalable in different realities and communities, to co-design our society starting from the squares, streets, shops and places we live day by day, and open this access to the world via mobile, giving opportunities for all.</p>

So, why aren&rsquo;t you getting a piece of the pie? Offering your coding skills as a freelancer means you get to set your own rates, select your projects, and create on your time table. Even if you need to dust off those coding skills or add a few new languages to your repertoire, according to <strong><a href=""https://sanantoniocodingacademy.com/"">San Antonio Coding Academy</a></strong>, you can do this in as little as two nights a week! With some fine-tuned, up-to-date coding skills, you can be bringing in extra cash in no time!</p>
<p><strong>3. Teach Others</strong><br />Let&rsquo;s say your skills are already off the charts. Share the wisdom! There is a huge demand for coding skills right now and people need proficient teachers to supply the demand! With so many people wanting to <strong><a href=""https://sanantoniocodingacademy.com/"">learn coding</a></strong>, turning teaching into an income stream is a no-brainer. You can teach at your local coding school or offer your services online. Many existing online services need mentors for students as well!</p>
<p><strong>4. Participate in Programming Contests</strong><br />Did you know you can even earn money competing as a coder? There are several online contests provided through websites like <strong><a href=""http://topcoder.com/"">Top Coder</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://www.codechef.com/"">Code Chef</a></strong>. that offer an easy way to earn some extra cash for the coder extraordinaire. They&rsquo;re easy to join and contestants have walked away with cash, prizes, and sometimes even job offers! What better way to spend your spare time than building bragging rights and making some moolah!<br /><br />The bottom line is don&rsquo;t let those coding skills go to waste! It&rsquo;s like leaving money under your mattress. It&rsquo;s not earning interest, it&rsquo;s not building anything, and it&rsquo;s not maximizing it&rsquo;s potential. It&rsquo;s not doing anything for anybody! That same money could be invested and grow into so much more! Besides, if you don&rsquo;t use it, you lose it! So, drag out those coding skills, dust them off, and get to earning! Turn your skills into cold hard cash!</p>",,2017-02-07,2060-02-07,"United States","Los Angeles",34.054935,-118.2444759,,"software development, technology","Education and skills","Open networks",,2017-02-07

One of the most prominent examples of collaboration online is Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. It is a system where conflict is mediated by both policy and software, and where conflicts often reflect larger societal debates. <br /><br />We are building a platform for the real-time analysis and visualization of such controversies in Wikipedia. Controversy metrics are extracted from the real time activity streams generated by edits to, and discussions about, individual articles and groups of related articles. An article&rsquo;s revision history and its corresponding discussion pages constitute two parallel streams of user interactions that, taken together, fully describe the process of the collaborative creation of an article. Our platform, Contropedia, builds on state of the art techniques and extends current metrics for the analysis of both edit and discussion activity. Furthermore, the combination of these two approaches allows for a deeper understanding of the substance, composition, actor alignment, trajectory and liveliness of controversies on Wikipedia.<br /><br />The platform is designed with a special focus on the utility of the metrics and the public relevance of the visualizations: the metrics focus on the extraction of societal controversies while the visualizations aid in shaping new knowledge about the controversial topic.<br /><br /><br /><br />This research was made possible by EU FP7 EINS grant #288021 and in part by EU FP7 EMAPS grant #288964.</p>","<p>Our research aims to provide a better understanding of socio-technical phenomena that take place on the Internet and to equip citizens with tools to fully deploy the complexity of controversies.

<p><br /> To achieve this goal, the Foundation counts with the cybervolunteers. Curious, proactive persons willing to learn, with a passion for sharing and enthusiasm about ICTs, who offer part of their time and knowledge to teach other people the possibilities of the use of technology tools and applications to improve their lives in a simple and useful way. They do it through both online and onsite courses, lectures, workshops, events&hellip; etc.</p>
<p><br /> They direct their action to groups of people that may be excluded from information society based on gender, age, professional and social environment, lack of time, knowledge, skills, motivation and/or material or economic resources... and they manage to adapt the use of technological applications to alleviate these social gaps at working, participation or health levels, among others. &hellip; A challenge, 15 years of work that without going any further than last year received from the hands of the Prince and Princess of Asturias a recognition for &ldquo;the creation of new forms of participation and social innovation in support of groups at risk of exclusion&rdquo;, and the economic and social recognition of Google.org, for being one of 50 entities that are changing the world, the first and currently the only organization recognized with such merit in Spain.</p>
<p><br /> <br /> Topics that we work: ICT, social innovation, gamification, social-ict lab, digital skills, e-inclusion, e-health, volunteering, citizen participation and entrepreneurship for social change, e-leadership, cybersecurity, and privacity between others<br /> Also Cibervoluntarios develops activities to promote digital skills for a wide range of people (with special needs, with fewer education, with employability needs...) in a wide range of non formal education activities.</p>
<p><br /> We have participated in several European projects (H2020, Eramus +, FP7, Leonardo, Grundtvig, Youth in Action)&nbsp; Our role as partner can be as Living Lab (testing different technological tools/applications/services/<br /> products) or offering or sharing our know-how (in technological volunteerism, citizen empowerment, social innovation through ICTs, cybersecurity, social entrepreurchip, digital literacy...) between others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>With technology, social innovation is in our hands We cre cybervolunteers, we are cyberoptimistic. Because we live in a historic moment, like no other, in which the appropriation of technology is the key to eliminating social gaps. Inherited gaps that are related to with the educational, labor, social, participation, health development ... that have to do with human development. And closing these gaps, for the first time, is in the hands of citizens themselves. Because technology gives us a chance, one for every single one, to become the main characters, technological social entrepreneurs, capable of changing the world. This transformation is the result of an informed and engaged citizenship. A citizenship that knows how to use the tools, applications, contents and technological services at its disposal to generate a wealthy and better world. Because addressing real needs is generating innovation and social change.

291,"Design for Social Innovation through Social Computing",,,"The research of this DESIS Lab shall confront aforementioned three challenges, focusing in social computing not just as a technology, but more importantly as an enabler (a platform or a tool) in a design context.

Social computing is firstly seen as the computational facilitation of service centric design that integrates the Web of People with the Internet of things, that shortens the feedback loop in adaptive systems and services, and that enables the service to be carried out in in a more flattened and bottom up social structure. With the facilitation service design can be carried out in an interactive and sustainable process. In this process data and input can be collected social interaction among the uses and the stakeholders and from the behavior of the users and the products, analyzed and quickly or directly fed back to the process. There is a need to investigate how to tightly combine and coordinate these computational, physical and social elements to facilitate the service and the design process of it.

Social computing is also seen as a computational platform for social innovation. The aim of the research in this respect is to develop methods, tools and techniques based on social computing to support design as social innovation and design for social innovation. In the case of design as social innovation, the research shall investigate how social computing can be used to support the collaborative design activities by the designers as well as other stakeholders including the end users and to enable collective creativity and intelligence in dealing with the complexity of the systems of today. In the case of design for social innovation, the research shall investigate how to use social computing for design to trigger and support social innovation that leads to societal transformations, by introducing design perspectives and design intervention in a social context.

Social computing could be used for validating design in earlier phases of the process. It is interesting to investigate how social computing could be utilized as a simulation platform for earlier concepts  in this case physical prototypes might be still be necessary but the situational context (people, other things and the environment) can be brought in or closer in order to quest the concept earlier.

The perspective and the competency of using social computing as an enabler in design should be implemented in the design education if the aim of the education is creating intelligent systems, products and related services in a social context. This research should investigate how this can be carried out in a competency-centered learning process, and how to utilize the social computing technologies to facilitate this process.",,,,,,,,223,,"Culture and arts, Education and skills, Health and wellbeing","Open data, Open knowledge","Artificial intelligence and machine learning, big data, Geotagging, GPS and GIS, Mobile and web apps, open data, Open-source technologies, sensors and internet of things, Social networks and social media",1970-01-01

The three main outcomes of the project will be:

1. Older people in sheltered housing schemes have improved quality of life including being less isolated, more mentally active, better informed and better off financially because they are more digitally included.
2. Older people involved in the intergenerational theme of the project have increased contact across the generations leading to more developed online skills for older people and better communication skills for young people leading to a better understanding of each other for both groups.

44,DisciplineXgames,,,"The Problem:
The phenomenon has been well documented, hyperbolic discounting is the human tendency to prefer smaller payoffs now over larger payoffs later, which leads one to largely disregard the future when it requires sacrifices in the present.
""Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die."" It's an appealing philosophy to some, but for an average person in the modern world, on any given day we are roughly 26,000 times more likely to be wrong than right about tomorrow's survivability. More often than not, one must answer for all reckless consumption and merriment; yet most of us continue to make choices which are detrimental to our futures.
 
Our Solution:
We believe that a behavioural change intervention, at a social-network level, is required if we are to calm our rate of consumption to manageable levels.
 
We have leveraged behavioural economics techniques from the evidence based, Road Safety  Average Speed Camera Intervention to allow people to self-select themselves to a programme of social surveillance, using wearable devices to remotely compete in games of discipline against friends and family, and by so doing maintain target behaviours that reduce consumption rates or increase activity levels to compensate for consumption rates.
 
Why Now:
The explosion of sensors we are witnessing today is spurring innovation across industry due to their effectiveness of price point, innovation in what can be measured, and the existence of ubiquitous networks to allow the aggregation of that data. 

For the first time we have the technology to monitor and validate adherence to target behaviour remotely. Nowhere is that more important than in the health and wellbeing space, where the world faces epic challenges coming from an aging population, a centralised health system that is straining to scale to current demands, and growing health concerns due to obesity and diabetes.

<p>Across Europe a growing movement of tech entrepreneurs is developing inspiring digital solutions to social challenges. These range from social networks for those living with chronic health conditions, to online platforms for citizen participation in policymaking, to using open data to create more transparency about public spending. We call this digital social innovation (DSI). We have set up digitalsocial.eu to build a network of digital social innovation in Europe. People and projects interested in DSI can use the site to showcase their work, learn about DSI, find collaborators for projects and find information on events and funding opportunities for DSI.</p>

Our first goal is to empower people to actively participate in reporting and resolving ecological issues in their local communities and to share positive stories about individuals and organizations involved in resolving ecology problems.

In order to accomplish this goal we have to create a hustle free tool for people to use for reporting and centralized location for reported issues to be stored and displayed for everyone to see and react.

We believe that our project has much larger prospect beyond this, and that it will grow into network which will include not only individuals and NGOs but also municipal and governmental bodies, schools etc. Also, since it deals with issues that are global, we believe that it has potential to easily spread outside country borders and become global.

This project will give people opportunity to get involved. At the same time their involvement will leverage visibility of these issues and put public pressure on perpetrators through social network. This should result in significant reduction of number of actions that are harmful for the environment and in increase of positive actions done by individuals and organizations.

It used to be the newspaper, then it was UCAS Online, now it seems that every student reaches into their pocket and grabs their smartphone, not to call their family members, but to search for their university course. That&rsquo;s the reason that ed-tech company, <strong><a href=""https://universitycompare.com/"">University Compare</a></strong> is slowly becoming a household name.</p>
<p>University Compare raised $262,575 in their latest funding round to help demystify the university application process and to provide guidance to those <strong><a href=""https://universitycompare.com/university-advice/"">applying to university</a></strong>. University Compare&rsquo;s App &lsquo;Clearing&rsquo; was a major milestone this year thanks to it sitting still of the UK App store for more than one week and generating more than 28 million app store views.</p>
<p>Imagine that you&rsquo;re an 18-year-old college student and your results were not exactly what you had hoped for, or better than expected - the odds are you are likely to change your university. You now have to search through tens of thousands of courses and fast. It needs something innovative and Owen O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s mobile venture did exactly that, it&rsquo;s also probably why the search term &lsquo;Clearing&rsquo; was seen all August.</p>
<p>University Compare&rsquo;s app &lsquo;Clearing&rsquo; featured helped fund more than &pound;60m worth of university tuition, a major dent in the higher education section thanks to over 46,000 user logins on A Level Results Day. Owen O&rsquo;Neill went on to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A student logged into use our service every 1.8s, which, as we watched in real-time on the day was phenomenal. It&rsquo;s clear that there is a shift in the way students research their university choices and luckily we&rsquo;re at the forefront of this movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know entering into Clearing can be an emotional experience for school leavers, so we put a lot of time and effort into developing an app that serves as a useful and easy-to-use resource with the kind of info we know students want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>University Compare has gone from strength-to-strength and boasts some impressive stats, they are set to hit a 1000% increase in their student registrations along with a 300% increase in site traffic, all in 9 short months - it seems this edtech company is making clear and yet very smart moves.</p>
<p>The site uses reviews from former students with a social-led rating system, users can compare average graduate salaries, employment rates, student satisfaction and even the cost of a local pint at the university they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Their latest funding round was secured via Seedrs.com and scooped &pound;75,000 from previous Sportingbet founder, Mark Blandford. Sportingbet was sold to William Hill in 2013 for an est. $650 million. Mark Blandford when on to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;University Compare has a clear value proposition in a growing marketing, in my opinion, O&rsquo;Neill understands the opportunity and how to execute on it.

Instead, the game mechanics will blend virtual and real-world experiences so that location-aware games extend past our televisions, weaving the magic of gameplay into multiple real objects and locations.

of University and Research of Italy for young reseachers under 30 years.
First Life proposes a new social network which revises the basis of existing ones and has the following
characteristics:
1) It offers a geo-referenced representation like Google Maps does, but it is more dense and interactive.
2) It does not have a global scope, but it is focused on neighours, the dimension where we live our
everyday life.
3) It is mediated in that every neighbourhood is associated with a journalist which re-elaborates the
information put by citizens on the social network and manages a local newspaper proposing topics of
interests for the citizens.
By more dense and interactive we mean that the citizens can not only put opinions on restaurants like it
happens now, but they can put information about every aspect of the local reality they live in, from
schools to playgrounds, from entertainment events to local news. First life will be populated with entities
downloaded from open data (hospitals, shops, etc.) or added by users, which can create their own forms
describing the fields of the entities and classifying them according to an ontology of social practices. For
every entity, users can add information, blogs, pictures, or organize online events, like chats to discuss
related issues.
The goal of First Life is to make citizens more connected, more conscious of the place they live in and
more active. First Life harvests the knowledge and services which are now scattered around many
websites often unknown to the wide public websites, focusing them on a local area. It reduces the
overloading of information by filtering them on a locality principle. It can be the basis for co-production
(in the sense of the Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom) and Do It Yourself activities, it can be used to advertise
new shops, services or events in the local area, it allows people to organize their own events, to start
discussions on local issues.
The business model ensuring the sustainability of the project is to be financed by advertisements and by
contribution of citizens which want to become stakeholders of the local newspapers. Starting from a first
test neighbourhood, First Life will be extended to other ones and other cities using a franchising
mechanism.
First Life respond to the worries raised by existing social networks, such Google+ and Facebook. First,
the so called filter bubble noted by Eli Pariser: the personalization of information from social media
closes us in a private world reducing the opportunities for serendipity. Second, the reduction of social
space by social media, leading to an urban desert: as Evgeny Morozov says, public space is only what
separates our home from the restaurant with good online reviews our Google Car is driving us to.",,,,,,,,72,,"Neighbourhood regeneration, Participation and democracy","Open data, Open knowledge, Open networks","Crowdsourcing, crowdmapping and crowdfunding, Geotagging, GPS and GIS, Mobile and web apps, Online marketplaces and noticeboards, Peer-to-peer networks, Social networks and social media",1970-01-01

816,hackAIR,http://www.hackair.eu/,"hackAIR is an open technology platform that you can use to access, collect and improve air quality information in Europe.","<p><strong>Did you know?&nbsp;</strong>Air pollution kills over ten times more people than road accidents in the EU. Around 90% of Europeans living in cities are exposed to levels of air pollution deemed damaging to human health.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to improve our air...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Air pollution is the single environmental issue Europeans worry about the most.</li>
<li>Nearly six out of ten Europeans do not feel sufficiently informed about air quality issues in their country.</li>
<li>Poor air quality has serious health and lifespan implications and causes harm to the natural environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>...with better data!</strong></p>
<p>Knowing more about air quality is the first step to improving it.</p>
<p>The project hackAIR joins the movement to improve air quality data in Europe through participatory sensing technology and citizen engagement. We build an open technology platform that you can use to access, collect and improve air quality information in Europe.</p>
<p>hackAIR consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a customisable web application for local air quality; and</li>
<li>a mobile app that citizens can use to access to air quality information or contribute measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs will be available for fetching information from the database.</p>
<p><strong>Open technology</strong></p>
<p>hackAIR combines official air quality data with a number of community-driven data sources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>an easy-to-build open hardware sensor module that transmits regular air quality measurements via Bluetooth;</li>
<li>air quality information derived from mobile phone pictures of the sky and webcams; and</li>
<li>a low-tech measurement setup involving paper filters and aquarium air pumps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Participatory sensing and engagement</strong></p>
<p>With hackAIR, we want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>involve citizens directly in measuring and publishing outdoor air pollution levels;</li>
<li>contribute to the awareness and citizen engagement on air quality issues; and</li>
<li>encourage behavioural change towards a cleaner air.</li>
</ul>
<p>hackAIR will build on research on public engagement and behavioural change to tap into motivations for engaging in the participatory sensing on air quality and the elements that cause behavioural change.</p>
<p>hackAIR's participatory approach starts by designing the requirements for the hackAIR platform in collaboration with users and in line with technical possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot projects</strong></p>
<p>In Germany, environmental activists organised by the Friends of the Earth network are campaigning for beer air quality policy. In 2017, they plan to use hackAIR to:</p>
<ul>
<li>raise local awareness of air quality issues; and</li>
<li>engage schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Norway, citizens and researchers have set up an air quality monitoring network. In 2017, they plan to use hackAIR to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide air quality information for health-conscious citizens; and</li>
<li>encourage behavioural change.</li>
</ul>","<p>Improving air quality in Europe requires action on many levels: from citizens and NGOs to policy makers. hackAIR helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fill current gaps in areas where the distance between sensors may be significant;</li>
<li>improve access to data from different sources; and</li>
<li>provide up to date air quality information.</li>
</ul>
<p>hackAIR will enable communities of citizens to:</p>
<ul>
<li>map their neighbourhood's air by taking pictures of the sky;</li>
<li>provide measurements themselves, through easy-to-build open hardware sensors; and</li>
<li>see how air quality changes over time &ndash; and compare with other cities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The technology developed will be of interest to policy makers, educators and technology enthusiasts: everybody can use it to manage their own air quality monitoring station - and help others learn about DIY sensing.</p>
<p>Individuals can use the information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid polluting behaviour (e.g. through their choice of transport);</li>
<li>reduce their exposure to air pollution (e.g. by deciding or adjusting the time and route of travel); or</li>
<li>participate in the public discourse on improved air quality (e.g. by writing letters to policymakers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Scientists and policy makers can use the resulting air quality data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>gain insights on air quality patterns; and</li>
<li>inform public policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>For 2017, we are looking for organisations interested in hosting local hackAIR workshops to build awareness of air quality and explore the technology in practice. Contact us!</p>

<p>Its main goal is to provide equal rights in social, affordable and appropriate housing, and public space for all the citizens, regardless of their cultural, social and economic differences. The project aims to increase the level of citizen&rsquo;s satisfaction with public services, to increase citizens and NGOs participation in local public discussions and to increase their influence in policymaking. It targets cultural and socio-economical marginalized groups, local decision makers, and the general public in municipalities of Prishtina, Gjakova, Gjilan, Ferizaj and Fushe Kosova. Implementation of the project started on 1st&nbsp;of September 2015 and is expected to end on 28th&nbsp;of February 2017.</p>
<p><strong>The main aims of the project are:</strong></p>
<div>The training of interest groups in using contemporary tools and methodologies for activism and influencing decision-making processes. The aim of the project is to involve and activate the general society and civil society organizations in political and public life, with the purpose of achieving good local governance, increasing the quality of services, gender equality and integrating minorities and other marginalized groups in fields related to public space and social housing.</div>
<div>Drafting local manuals for social and affordable housing for the citizens, which are supposed to be considered or applied by the Municipality.The manuals for social housing will be drafted based on official laws and documents, existing field conditions, needs of groups of interest, successful examples in the world and in consultation with local and international experts. Through these manuals it is aimed to create strategies and proper living conditions for the citizens.</div>
<div>Founding inclusive advisory groups for decision-making in social housing.The aim of these groups, which will also include women, disabled people and marginalized groups, is to provide equal dissemination of social housing units within municipalities in the best possible way, by prioritizing the most needed beneficiaries.</div>
<div>Building mechanisms for accountability to the citizens.It includes building a communication/reporting platform for smart phones for reporting the damages or misuse of public space and social housing. Reporting will be done by sending photographs and describing the damage/misuse and its location in the application. These complaints will be sent to the municipality&rsquo;s inspectorate, which is expected to intervene with the needed measures. Thus the communication and transparency between the municipality and citizens will increase.</div>
<div>Raising public awareness for the universal right to public space, social and affordable housing.Within the project will be organized public debates and discussions among local decision makers, NGO-s and the general public, presentations for high school students and workshops for local students and groups of interest, and will be published informing brochures for the citizens&rsquo; rights and responsibilities in public space and for application methods and conditions for social and affordable housing.</div>","<p>Raising public awareness for the universal right to public space, social and affordable housing.Within the project will be organized public debates and discussions among local decision makers, NGO-s and the general public, presentations for high school students and workshops for local students and groups of interest, and will be published informing brochures for the citizens&rsquo; rights and responsibilities in public space and for application methods and conditions for social and affordable housing.</p>",2015-09-01,,Albania,Prishtina,41.3350459,19.492836,1231,"digital social innovation, housing, social equity, urban regeneration","Neighbourhood regeneration, Participation and democracy","Open knowledge","Mobile and web apps",2017-01-18

Lokalizo through its partnership with Voices of Youth Maps offers a youth friendly technology that can be used by trained young people to securely collect stories and reports regarding their neighborhood.

Aggregated reports serve as a powerful tool to promote interventions by the community and its leaders to achieve the desired changes. The Lokalizo project addresses 9 thematic categories: walking hazards, accumulation of garbage, collapse risks, water management, recreational parks, urban traffic, sanitation problems, urban green spaces and forests, response to humanitarian disasters. 

(In respect to the latter category and in light of the recent floods in the Balkans, our team has been invited at the Mikser Festival 2014 in Belgrade to present how youth-led initiatives similar to Lokalizo can respond to such crisis in the future.)

Our team has been able to create a solid circle of stakeholders in the city of Prishtina, while we are working everyday to expand this circle. Simultaneously, we are looking at opportunities to expand the service offered through Lokalizo to other cities, with the goal to stretch on national level. 

The social enterprise contributes positively to social change by empowering a number of people who join us as youth mappers. While the activism of young people pushes governmental institutions to join us as stakeholders and collaborate to jointly improve the quality of life in our communities.  Lokalizo successfully creates feedback loops where direct communication between agents of positive change, elected representatives, and those responsible to provide remedies can easily collaborate to establish the needed results.

<p>Make Things Do Stuff launched in 2013 as a campaign and website designed to mobilise the next generation of digital makers. Since then, over 70 organisations from large technology companies, to grassroot clubs provided over 100,000 digital making experiences to young people nationwide.</p>
<p>Our aim has always been to support the groundswell of organisations educating young people to creatively harness the power of technology, to look at ways of assisting their delivery and promote the excellent work being undertaken across all fields of digital skills education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How has Make Things Do Stuff evolved?</strong></p>
<p>With creative digital making platforms such as the BBC's&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://www.mixital.co.uk/"">Mixital</a>&nbsp;</strong>now providing access to the kinds of inspirational tools and projects Make Things Do Stuff used to provide, we identified a new need for a comprehensive directory of UK digital making provision - a one-stop-shop of organisations supporting young people to develop their digital skills that can be filtered by categories such as region and technology-type.</p>

In the past five years, the broad availability of open hardware tools, the creation of online data sharing platforms, and access to maker spaces have fostered the design of low cost and open source sensors that citizens can appropriate to engage in environmental action. By collectively measuring and making sense of their environment, citizens can become aware of how their lifestyle affects the ecosystem and be inspired to adopt more sustainable behaviours.</p>
<p>Official bodies typically measure environmental qualities with sparse networks of high quality sensors, and the resulting data are analysed to inform policy and regulations. At the same time, with the exception of extreme cases like smog pollution, citizens tend to be unaware of the health threats that they are subjected to on a daily basis. Moreover, they lack the means to act on their own behalf. By encouraging and enabling the creation of bottom-up sensor networks, and sharing the resulting data and knowledge, the EU-funded project Making Sense aims to add to the available data and understanding, and contribute to a healthier and cleaner environment.</p>
<p><strong>Toolkit</strong><br />Making Sense will show how open source software, open source hardware, digital maker practices and open design can be used by local communities to make sense of their environments. It will develop a <strong>Making Sense Toolkit</strong> based on the <a class=""ext"" href=""https://smartcitizen.me/"" target=""_blank"">Smart Citizen</a> platform for bottom up citizen science, developed at Fablab Barcelona. The toolkit will be developed and tested in nine pilots in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Pristina.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on these pilots, we will develop framework for participatory environmental maker practices. It will show how to provide citizens and communities with tools to enhance their everyday environmental awareness, to enable active intervention in their surroundings, and to change their individual and collective practices. And finally we will develop will develop a framework for citizen co-inquiry and action towards transformation of their surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholders and funding</strong><br />Making Sense will run from November 2015 to the end of 2017.

469,Medhance,,,"The beneficiaries of the project will be patients that require the use of clinical skills for a given medical condition. Medhance has benefits for each, which the current methods do not provide. There are a vast number and a range of patient requiring different clinical skills thus it cannot be quantified into a single figure but this is a huge potential audience.

Medhance will also benefit patients who are poorly educated, in a low socio-economic class, in an ethnic minority speaking little English or require a carer. Even though it takes these patients into account, it is aimed at all patients requiring the use of a clinical skill no matter what their background is. Thus could potentially have a dangerous result of not knowing how to perform their clinical skill correctly, due to not having suitable and validated resources targetted to them. While patients who are well educated or in a high socioeconomic class have access to a wider range of facilities along with better understanding. This is reflected, not just across the UK but throughout Europe. 

For patients who are poorly educated, the features in Medhance are perfectly suited to them. So if they are not able to read or have poor literacy skills along with poor understanding of complex medical terminology, then the patient can be shown how to perform the clinical skill via a video, which they can watch at their own pace or repeatedly if they wanted to. 

For patients who are in a lower socio-economic class and cannot afford the access to advanced resources, Medhance does not charge them. This is because the content is free as the healthcare provider covers the cost for a small fee. This allows them to have the same benefits as higher socio-economic classes. 

For patients who are from ethic minorities and do not speak much English, Medhance overcomes this barrier by making the information available in several languages. Thus having the information already translated does not make them rely on translators or using relatives as translators, which can be life-threatening when used for medical information. 

For patients who require a carer such a specific elderly patients, Medhance allows there carers to use this if they were not present when showed the skill. It also has advantages for patients who are affected by more than one medical condition and require the use of several clinical skills.

738,MuseomixUK,,,"Museomix is inspired by the open, participative and networked practices that have emerged from the web. It?s an event-driven community of museum innovators that harnesses their collective energies over three days, and enables them to change the museum from within.

The Museomix project was founded in 2011 by five very different persons and entities working in the culture and innovation sectors: the agencies Nod-a and Buzzeum, the research laboratory Erasme, Samuel Bausson and Julien Dorra. It is now driven by an  active community of art and history enthusiasts, museum staff, innovators, designers, coders, community organizers, makers and tinkerers that grows each year, including The French Ministry of Cultural Affairs.

Why is Museomix here?
If we are not satisfied with the way museums work, why not make the museum we would love to visit and work for? Why not make it a creative platform? This is the question we asked when setting up Museomix.

We love museums, but sometimes it feels like museums don?t really love us back. They are filled with rules, shushing guards, admonitions against photography. They can give us a sense that we?re somewhere we don?t belong, where our rights and agency are diminished, where we are more limited than usual to do, or play, as we please.

Museum professionals ? especially those working in digital and the web ? are frequently frustrated: there are many new possibilities for mediation and the museum experience. They are discussed in conferences and prototyped in workshops. But when museum professionals try to bring these ideas back to their own museums, innovation can seem out of reach.

Museomix was born out of this frustration. It?s a way to bridge the gap between participatory web culture and institutional museum culture, between peer-to-peer logic and pyramidal organisation.

Museomix wants to demonstrate that museums can work differently, and that a disruptive experience can initiate change throughout an organisation.

Over three days Museomix make it happen for real in museums where people can be creative and have an immediate impact.

Beyond visitors: reaching out to museum user communities
Visitors want many things out of their museum visit: students, teachers, parents and children; designers, artists and photographers; tourists and researchers; amateurs and bloggers ? all have different motivations to visit.

If you look closely at their habits and practices, you?ll find that they are much more than visitors: they are really museum users.

Beyond simply watching, they seek diverse experiences: photographing, drawing, posing, dancing, learning, loitering, meeting, eating ? experiences that they like to share with friends, and that they can?t always have in museums.

Museomix opens the door to people who want to make a place for themselves. Museomix lets visitors imagine a cultural space that let them become engaged users and evolves with them.

The Museomix community shares a vision of today?s museum, co-edited in 2012:

a museum that is open and inclusive to people, their uses, and the use of their content;
a museum that is connected, and works outside-in with its user communities;
a participatory museum, where contemplating is one of many ways to relate artworks, where people can share and create ? a read-write museum.

774,netCommons,http://netcommons.eu,"netCommons proposes a novel transdisciplinary methodology on promoting and supporting the creation of networks as commons.","<p>nformation and communication technologies are key components of a modern society, and their control is the key to societal development. The advent of the Internet has been often invoked as a remedy for their democratization and the diffusion of fundamental human rights. The light of truth shows today a different picture: the digital divide is widening the gap between those who can access and take advantage of the new systems, and those who remain &ldquo;disconnected&rdquo; (with respect to physical access to technology, economic advantages, cultural uses and skills, and democratic impacts). A problem is emerging about the Internet&rsquo;s sustainability, both socio-economic (large Internet corporations eluding taxes and aggressively commercializing most services) and political-democratic (the global Internet surveillance and the lack of transparency). This, coupled with the complexity of the Internet&rsquo;s organisation and the diffused lack of awareness about its actual implementation makes the users easy targets of manipulation, and unaware of the possibility to have a bottom-up, democratic, communal organisation of &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;.<br /><br />netCommons aspires to study, support and further promote an emerging trend, community-based networking and communication services that can offer a complement, or even a sustainable alternative, to the global Internet&rsquo;s current dominant model. Community networks not only provide citizens with access to a neutral, bottom-up network infrastructure, which naturally increases the transparency of data flow, but they also represent an archetype of networked collective cooperation and action, mixing common or communal ownership and management of an infrastructure with a balanced set of services supported by the local stakeholders. Community networks, however, are complex systems that require multiple skills to thrive: technical, legal, socio-economic, and political. They face many challenges and they also need abstractions, models and practical tools to grow and produce a higher beneficial impact on our society.<br /><br />netCommons follows a dual approach to achieve the maximum possible impact. On the one hand, the project works at the local level, mingling with the communities that implement and manage community networks to gather relevant information, elaborate it, and then return to communities advanced conceptual and technical tools helping them to grow and thrive. On the other hand, starting from such hands-on experience and work, netCommons contributes to Internet Science by abstracting concepts and opening the perspective to the world of global communications. It studies solutions and interpretations of how to build global awareness about the importance of sustainability, participation, co-operation, freedom, democracy, peer production, the public and common good, and the role of community networks to help this process. Consequently, netCommons will foster the implementation of the proper actions (local to communities and global to the regulatory level) that can guarantee that information creation and diffusion remains free, neutral, fair, and respectful of individual rights.</p>","<p>netCommons will support the many communities that are building community networks with the publication of practices, software and recommendations that will help them grow their activity in a sustainable way.</p>",2016-01-01,2018-12-31,,,,,"183, 313, 347, 590, 1180","community, community networks, ICT, sustainabilty",Science,"Open networks",,1970-01-01

In a couple of months, over 10,000 anonymous players from over 100 countries played over 12,000 games and generated a database of over 300,000 clicks. It was shown that an algorithm that combines 13 games from non-experts playing on the same image translates into a perfect parasite counting- as good as an expert microscopist.

<p>Epochal changes in science, technology and globalization have transformed traditional power structures in the world, opening the way for citizens to participate in society in a way that they could not before. And change is accelerating. While we do not know what tomorrow&rsquo;s problems are going to be, we know there will be many, and we know we will need everyone equipped to deal with them. We all must be emphatic innovators, able to collaborate, create, and act in changing environments.</p>
<p>Opencare brings people together, in the virtual and physical world, to share stories and create new solutions rooted in people's everyday realities, needs, and lifestyles.</p>","<p>For most of humanity's history, care services &ndash; which today we call health and social care &ndash; were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other's children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.</p>
<p>This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people&hellip;) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong></p>
<p>We are going to attempt to do just that. We are launching OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>collect experiences of community-driven care services</li>
<li>validate them through open discussion, both online and offline.</li>
<li>augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking&hellip;)</li>
<li>combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we'll do it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process will be &ndash; and stay &ndash; open to anyone who wants to participate. We are working on a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution, and will not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>Care is deeply human</strong>. Everyone has first-hand experience of it. Even those if us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receving care. So, everyone is welcome to join the conversation and the subsequent prototypes.

<p>OpenCare is led by YOU, and assisted by a world-class partnership: Edgeryders, the University of Bordeaux, the City of Milan, WeMake, ScImpulse Foundation and the Stockholm School of Economics. &nbsp;We will find a way to move forward together.

We have achieved this through a process we branded as Our MK, taking people&rsquo;s initial ideas and supporting them to become a reality. The 4 key elements involved have been:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Community Engagement</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Development of Ideas</span></li>

<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Support &amp; Guidance</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">MK:Smart has been a useful way of trying and testing an effective process for supporting citizen innovation and we are now looking to extend this beyond the end of the MK:Smart project.</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Community Engagement</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Community engagement is a fundamental baseline to all successful projects. We engaged people using Community Action: MK&rsquo;s Community Mobilisers. They went out into communities to initiate conversations face to face about smart city topics, which were all recorded on our </span><strong>QuickChat Dialogue App</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. We collected over 900 pieces of conversation in the initial stages of the project, which gave an insight to people&rsquo;s priorities. We are also able to target hard to reach groups, such as in more deprived areas, ethnic minorities and young people, that are least likely to bring themselves into such conversations.</span></p>

<h3><strong>2. Development of Ideas</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bringing like minded people together, is also a useful way to spark further discussion and initiate new ideas. We provided people with the opportunity to collaborate in two ways; at </span><strong>workshops, focus groups and networking events</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">; and online via the </span><strong>Our MK Collaboration Platform</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a website where people could post ideas and collaborate on others ideas. This has formed the start of our</span><strong> Innovation Network </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a space where people can develop ideas and share and support each other. We already have over 280 people signed up to our regular newsletters, and even more have attended events.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can visit the Our MK website at </span><a href=""http://www.ourmk.org""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">www.ourmk.org</span></a></p>
<h3><strong>3. Competition for Funding &amp; Support</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Our MK Competition provided a target for people with ideas to work towards and encouraged citizens to consolidate their ideas into something achievable and within their reach. We promoted the opportunity widely using social media, newsletters, press releases, posters, newspaper adverts and shared information at our networking events. The </span><strong>application process</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> was fine tuned and the type of support was adapted based on what worked through this project.

The project promotes literacy in the fields of design, electronics and programming, by implementing a series of workshops for teen and preteen (ages 11-&shy;18) patients of the Pediatric Onco-hematology department and Transplant Center of Regina Margherita Hospital, in Turin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Robo&amp;Bobo is one of 19 projects awarded by the Digital for Social program, which were selected for the potential social or organizational impact of the promoting association, evaluated according to the level of technological innovation, feasibility, and financial sustainability of the project.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In particular, the workshops will focus on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the creation of simplified interactive artifacts, customizable through a combination of common materials and recycled electronic components and sensors (electronic boards like Arduino for example);</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the definition of a learning path for digital literacy, simplified 3D modeling, introduction to digital fabrication technology and 3D printing, plug&amp;play e-kits with sensors, actuators and conductive paint.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the activities aim to make IT skills stand out not only as learning goals, but as means to introduce new and interesting activities that make technology, science and design accessible, revealing their potential for play and creativity. The young adults involved in the workshops become active builders of their own knowledge path, leading to the pursuit of a growing reflection, awareness and self-assessment of their own cognitive processes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The project&rsquo;s main goals are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to enhance the educational / occupational offer available within the hospital;</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to offer tools that foster personal expression and cognitive empowerment;</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to offer participants the chance to come into direct contact with stimulating activities, completing an important, specific experience and learning also through hands-on practice;</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to offer useful tools to face periods of hospitalization, extending beyond workshop activities, with patients using what they have learned for their personal interest;</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to propose a model that is open to collaboration with similar local, national and international projects, building bridges and creating exchanges that can guarantee the growth and the replication of the project.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The project includes an initial phase focused on multidisciplinary planning (from the points of view of pedagogy, medicine, psychology, design, computer science and user experience) in collaboration with the hospital. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second, 9-month phase will focus on workshops being implemented, and monitored regularly to gather feedback.</span></li>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The final, 1-month phase will focus on feedback analysis and processing. The aim is to develop research for the definition of a method, and to trace guidelines so such method can be replicated in other hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Workshops will be led by operators with professional teaching and technical qualifications as well as by volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The project&rsquo;s communication platform will center on its dedicated website and social media.</span></p>

The social, economical and environmental details of real communities are conveyed inside the social network.

Individual, quantitative contribution is minimal; but collective, qualitative contribution is enormous, because of the ubiquity and capillarity achieved mixing public and private mobile communications infrastructure.

The social network is extended with a new layer featuring efficient access to smart community and city managed data, information and knowledge; both (1) emerging open-data models and (2) integrated development environments (enabling community members to easily create and deploy smart-community applications) play major roles in promoting crowd-sourced services, bottom-up innovation and citizen empowerment.

First, by interconnecting a multitude of human-sized communities, social trust stays strong&nbsp;and engagement is more likely to&nbsp;occur. Second, assuming that bad reputation repels and good reputation attracts, the IoC aims to explore how collective reputation can be used as a catalyst to regulate social interactions within these small social clusters. If individuals&rsquo; reputation affect each other, a collective reputation mechanism could act as a systematic incentive to inhibit behaviors that are detrimental to the collective reputational asset, and to foster those that are beneficial to the group. Third, unable to increase the size of their network beyond a certain limit, and tied by a collective reputation, users need&nbsp;to remain attractive to the rest of their community if they do not want to be replaced by more outstanding peers.&nbsp;As a result, there is a strong incentive to anchor relationships in reciprocity, fairness and excellence. Influence and leadership are&nbsp;more likely to shift to those who positively impact their communities, to those who lead by example, and to those who reciprocate with fairness.</p>","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Designed from first principles, this proposal for a distributed social environment introduces both a collective intelligence mechanism and a resource allocation system to actualize greater human, social and economic value from online communities. The desired output is for the Internet of Communities to become a working model for a distributed social system and the blueprint for new crowdsourcing initiatives.&nbsp;<em><span class=""a"">&ldquo;[..] The real disruption taking place is not technology? it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;</span><span class=""a"">trust shift that will open the doors to new and sometimes counter-intuitive &mdash; ways of designing&nbsp;</span><span class=""a"">&nbsp;</span></em><span class=""a""><em>systems that will change human behavior on a large scale&rdquo;.

VOICE  aims to define and offer a virtual, open innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem based on open innovation, crowd-sourcing and co-creation principles. Innovation and Entrepreneurship are key drivers towards a number of areas of social interest including:

- Job Creation  Start-ups to result from the VOICE ecosystem will actively contribute to new employment opportunities for the EU and the world. High-paid jobs are to be created since technology- oriented companies typically employ highly skilled employees. 
	Increased Entrepreneurial Activity  The innovative and international character of the Virtual Incubator, will create awareness of entrepreneurs and offer an easily accessible and friendly online environment that supports collaborative business creation across all incubation phases including the yet unexplored Interest phase. 
- Entrepreneurial Business Development Networks - The growing international entrepreneurial network of individuals, start-ups, universities, mentors, investors, government, and all other network stakeholders including the community, will stimulate the establishment of long-term, strong-ties and relationships that can create on-going business opportunities for all involved parties

Accelerate the transfer of innovative applications and services to the market

VOICE delivers its value proposition virtually via the Internet. This will enable it to provide its service offering to the international B2C, B2B and B2G targeted market segments in a fast, efficient and cost effective way, considering its strategic reach and impact. The VOICE ecosystem enables individuals that aspire to become entrepreneurs to tap into the collective intelligence of the crowd. Students, women, unemployed, individuals residing in remote areas will be offered the capability to engage and collaborate with entrepreneurs and mentors across the world in a friendly and engaging way.


Deployment of services sustaining the European  and global social model of an inclusive, cohesive information society for all, stimulating new activities leading to job creation; improving the competitiveness of European enterprises, in particular SMEs and strengthen the internal market

VOICE provides an innovative virtual platform that will facilitate open community collaboration towards entrepreneurship. As such VOICE bridges the gap between entrepreneurial need and action, reducing barriers to entry for both individuals and embryonic start-ups. VOICE  ecosystem provides business, technical and community services so as to enhance start-up growth and maximize their chances of survival. At the same time VOICE will act as an innovation marketplace and a global investment opportunity ecosystem for the B2B community (i.e., investment community, companies); as well as a medium for universities consulting companies and individuals to offer their services. By fulfilling these goals and supporting individuals and companies, across all stages from the need, to intellectual property ownership and control, to start-up creation, this virtual incubation ecosystem will thus contribute to the creation of jobs and wealth across the broader community. 

VOICE serves as inclusive, social entrepreneurship ecosystem that will offer an easily accessible online environment to support collaborative business creation. The online character of the VOICE will stimulate further the entrepreneurial and innovation activity by weakening existing imbalances for entrepreneurs between urban and rural areas by offering equal opportunities to individuals that do not live in major cities, to women and community groups with disabilities.

Even though &lsquo;water&rsquo; is an important asset within our urban environment - from our water tap to the river flowing under a bridge, from the rainwater to the grey-water pouring in the canals - nowadays citizens are strongly detached from the hidden dynamics of nature. We would like to bring back the link between natural resources such as water and society. To this aim, we plan to give citizens (mostly youngsters) the opportunity to monitor water quality during their everyday life. Although analysing water might seem a complex activity for experts, a number of affordable Do- It- Yourself (DIY) tools are available for domestic experimentation.&nbsp;</span>We see a lot of potential in these democratic tools because they empower young citizens in understanding environmental science in an interactive way.&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The purpose of this project is to build a public participation digital mapping to befor used by young citizens to monitor and record water quality in their area, as a part of a Citizen Science initiative. </span></p>
